# Fundament
Haskell game engine powered by SDL2 and Reflex FRP.

## Why reinvent the wheel?

Fundament's goals are roughly the same as those of [Helm](http://helm-engine.org/). So why not just use that?

- Helm's GTK+ dependencies rule out the possibility of building for mobile platforms. The Haskell GTK+ bindings are also currently very hard to build on some Windows systems.
- The Elerea FRP model is designed for simplicity, not efficiency or robustness. By contrast, [Reflex is engineered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qfc9XFVo2c) to be efficient at scale and to "make the right thing be the easy thing."
- Everyone knows new stuff is always better than old stuff. I mean, look how shiny it is!
